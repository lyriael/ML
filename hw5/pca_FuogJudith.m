% Let's do it again, I think I got the hang of it now!

function Eigen = pca_FuogJudith(Data, k)

% init, always handy to have.
% m - number of samples
% n - dimension
[m,n] = size(Data); 
X = Data'; % Example I follow uses it that way...

% Prepare data for svd. That means normalizing each sample to have zero mean and unit standart deviantion.
X -= mean(Data(:));
X /=std(X(:)); % Not sure if I need to do that.

% Following PCA procedure, we would now calculate the covariance of X, and then calculate the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of Sigma. Using SVD makes it a lot easier:
% A = USV'and AA'=USÂ²U'
% Here the columns of U contain the eigenvectors of AA' and the eigenvalues of AA' are the squares of the singular values in S.

[U, S, V] = svd(X);

% So we're basically done, we've got the eigenvalues which we need to return, but we should only return k-principal components. I would have thought, that we would return the best in descanding order, but I have found no way to figure out such a thing. So I'll just return the k-first principal components.

Eigen = U(:,1:k);

% X = [1 2 3;4 5 6;7 8 9;6 5 2;7 7 1] testing use only

The file 'main.m' runs all task of Questions 1-4. It's a rebuild from hw5.m, but 
it also includes the iterations and that are needed for plot the accuracy graph.

Question 4
-----------------------------------
- For the plot, see acuracy.png.
- For k >= 24 we have an average accurancy of at least 90%.
(See accuracy.txt and accuracy_precise.txt for output)
